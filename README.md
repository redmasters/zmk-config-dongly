# ‚å®Ô∏è ZMK Config for Corne with Dongle Support

This is my personal [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) configuration for my corne keyboard.
The configuration supports using the two halves as is or additionally use a
USB dongle.

## ü§î Why a Dongle?

For me, the most selling benefit of using a dongle is the keyboard availability
before entering an OS. This means, via the dongle you could, e.g., do the
following:

- Choose your OS in a bootloader
- Configure your UEFI

Other benefits, including a much longer battery life for the "pre-master" half
can be found [here](https://www.slicemk.com/pages/split-dongle).

## üöÄ Usage

Clone or fork this repository and trigger a new GitHub action. If you do not know
what that means check [this](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) out.

### Without Dongle

When using the firmware without a dongle you have to declare a master half that
communicates with your operating system. Flash your left half of your split
keyboard with the `corne_left*.uf2` file. Your right half has to be flashed

### With Dongle

Flash your dongle with the `corne_dongle*.uf2` file to use it as a master that
communicates over USB with your OS. Now, your left half does not need to be a
master anymore so flash it with the `corne_peripheral_left*.uf2` file.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

This repository uses [super mini promicro](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro/wiki/Alternatives#supermini-nrf52840) for
the split keyboard itself and for the dongle.
If you do not own the same hardware, this repository will not work without any
adjustments.

If you have the same hardware and still encounter connection issues,
be sure to reset your settings on all your hardware by flashing the
`settings_reset*.uf2` file as described [here](https://zmk.dev/docs/troubleshooting#split-keyboard-halves-unable-to-pair).
